            Check the email address you provided. If it is incorrect you can change it below.<br><br>
            If you're an essential worker and you have a work email address that you can access, it would help us if you used this. Change it to your work email, if you need to. If you do not have a work email address, a personal one is fine.<br><br>
            Make sure you're happy for your test results to go to this email address. Do not use a shared email address unless you're comfortable with others possibly seeing your results.<br><br>
            We'll use this to email you a code to confirm your identity.
