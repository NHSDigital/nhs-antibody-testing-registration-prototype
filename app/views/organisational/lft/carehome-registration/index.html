        Use this service to register coronavirus (COVID-19) tests for your organisation and report lateral flow test results.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're registering a test for yourself, you can still use this service. You can get the results sent directly to you by entering your personal contact details.

        Before you start
      </h2>

        <li>
          read the <a href="#">online guidance pack</a> and your printed instructions

        <li>
          if you need to, book your <a href="#">courier collection here</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          take tests on the same day you're returning the kits

        Get consent

      <p>Make sure people getting tested have freely given you consent to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          register them

          your 8 digit organisation number

        </li>
        <li>
          you'll need to record the details of staff and non-staff on separate spreadsheets

        <li>
          the barcode for each test
