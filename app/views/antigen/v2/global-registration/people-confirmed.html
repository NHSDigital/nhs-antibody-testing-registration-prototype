        You can <strong>add up to 3 people</strong> you live with for testing.<br><br>
        If you need tests for <strong>more than 4 people</strong>, you'll need to complete this journey again and place a separate order.<br><br>
        <strong>For test sites:</strong><br>
        If you're arriving by motorbike, you can only take one other person you live with. They must wear full helmet and visor.<br><br>
        If you’re arriving by car or small van, everyone must be in the same vehicle and sit next to a window that opens. You'll stay in your vehicle during your visit.<br><br>
        <strong>For home testing:</strong><br>
        You cannot order more than 4 home test kits at a time.

          People you live with who do not have symptoms can only get a PCR test if they’ve been in contact with someone who’s tested positive for COVID-19, or they have been asked to get a PCR test. Ordering unnecessary tests is wasting NHS resources.
