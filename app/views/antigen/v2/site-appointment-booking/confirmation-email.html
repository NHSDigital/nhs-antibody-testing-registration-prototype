     <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to bring to the test site</h2>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a copy of your test site pass (and passes for any children getting a test) - have the QR code in the pass ready to display (on the email, printed off or as a screenshot) or it could delay your entry to the test site</li>
      <li>photo ID - a driving licence or passport for each person getting a test</li>
      <li>hand-sanitiser or antiseptic wipes - because we may ask you to do the test yourself, so you'll need clean hands</li>
      <li>face coverings for each person aged 3 years and over, if you are visiting a walk-through site</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">You may also want to bring a bottle of water, as we cannot provide water at the test site.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens at the test site</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must turn up to your appointment on time, as this will help other people to be tested on time too.</p>

    <div class="govuk-warning-text">
      <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
      <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
        <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
        If you’re visiting a walk-through test site, you must wear a face covering
      </strong>
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll stay in your vehicle or testing bay during your visit.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Depending on which site you go to, you'll either be asked to do the test yourself (with instructions) or an assistant will do the swab test for you. Staff will let you know which test you'll be doing when you arrive at the test site.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Watch these videos to see what happens at the test sites.<br>
      <a class="govuk-link" href="#">Learn about self testing.</a><br>
      <a class="govuk-link" href="#">Learn about walk-through sites.</a>
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">It usually takes no more than 10 minutes to perform the test. You may have to wait to be tested, but you would not usually be at the test site for more than an hour.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll receive your test results by text message. Most people get their results within 48 hours, but it could take up to 5 days.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you're bringing a baby or a child</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you're bringing a child aged 11 or under to be tested, you (their parent or guardian) will be asked to swab test your child. You'll be given paper instructions.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll swab test your child either in a testing bay (walk-through) or from the back seat of your vehicle (drive-through). If you're going to a drive-through site, you may want to bring another adult, so one of you can already be seated in the back when you arrive. Otherwise, you'll need to climb onto the back seat.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll not be able to leave the vehicle or the testing bay during the test.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Before you swab test your child, you'll need to read the paper instructions. It can take about 20 minutes to read the instructions and then do the test.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You may want to bring something to keep your child entertained while you read and then swab yourself.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Do you need a BSL interpreter?</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you are Deaf and need a BSL interpreter during your drive-through test, <a href="#">download the free InterpreterNow app</a> before you appointment.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Can you help the NHS?</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you are over 50 and recently developed coronavirus symptoms, you may be able to take part in a clinical trial. <a href="#">Find out more and check if you qualify</a>.</p>
