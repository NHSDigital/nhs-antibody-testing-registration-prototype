            <li>everyone should wear a face covering, except children under the age of 3</li>
            <li>site staff will tell you if an assistant does the swab for you, or if you do it yourself</li>
            <li>at some sites you will be given a test that gives your result while you wait</li>
            <li>if this test is positive, you will be asked to take a follow-up test straight away which will be sent to a lab to confirm your results</li>
            <li>do not go to the site if you’re very unwell or if you’re at high risk (shielding) from coronavirus – <a class="govuk-link" href="/antigen/{{version}}/refer-and-triage/how-will-you-get-test">choose a home test instead</a></li>
