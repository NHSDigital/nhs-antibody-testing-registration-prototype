        <p class="govuk-body">We can only give tests to people with symptoms and people who have been asked to get tested. That's because there's a limited number of tests available right now.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Also, you may not be able to get a test if your symptoms started too long ago.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get advice on what to do next</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">If one of these situations applies to you, there are steps you can take to look after yourself and others.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I’ve been notified by NHS Test and Trace that I’m a contact of someone who has tested positive for coronavirus but I do not have symptoms</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You need to self-isolate immediately for 10 days. This includes the day you were in contact with that person and the next 10 full days.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Read more advice about <a class="govuk-link" href="#">when to self-isolate and what to do.</a></p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>You do not need a coronavirus test unless you go on to get symptoms.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I'm planning to visit someone at higher risk from coronavirus and want to make sure I do not have the virus</h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Avoid close contact with this person.</p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Wash your hands regularly, use a face covering when social distancing is not possible, and try to keep your distance from them.</p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="#">social distancing: what you need to do.</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">My employer or school has told me to get a test even though I do not have symptoms</h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>If your employer or school has asked you to get tested, and you do not have symptoms, you can pay for a private test.</p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>In this case, you cannot use this free service to get a test.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I need to get a test to travel to another country</h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>If your travel company has asked you to get tested, and you do not have symptoms, you can pay for a private test.</p>
        <p class='govuk-body'>In this case, you cannot use this free service to get a test.</p>
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I have arrived in the UK from another country and I need to get a test to stop self-isolating</h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="#">Test to Release for international travel scheme</a> in England, you can choose to pay for a private coronavirus test. If the result is negative you can stop self-isolating. You cannot use a free NHS coronavirus test to shorten your isolation.</p>
