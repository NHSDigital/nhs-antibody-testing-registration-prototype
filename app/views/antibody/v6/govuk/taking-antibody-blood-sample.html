                <p class="govuk-body">Hi, I'm Dr Sumera Shahaney, and I'm a GP in London. I'm going to walk you through how to collect your blood sample while Seth demonstrates each step.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Please feel free to stop this video as we go so that you can follow along.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Part 1: Prepare and set up</h3>

                <p class="govuk-body">Preparation is key. Before starting make sure that you follow these steps.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Give yourself about 30 minutes to prepare, get set up, and collect your sample — especially if this is your first time. Unlike some other blood tests, you don’t need to fast and you can do this test at any time of day. Just don’t do your test or post your test on a Saturday or Sunday as it might sit in the post for too long — any other day is fine.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">You need to drink a lot of water the day before you do the test. And on the day of the test. So aim for a minimum of 6-8 glasses the day before and at least 2 glasses 30 minutes before your test. This will make a really big difference as to how easy it is to collect your sample. If you haven't followed this step, please don't try to do this test today.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">To get your blood pumping, we recommend doing some movements (like jumping jacks, skipping on the spot, or swinging your arm and clenching and releasing your hand — or whatever you feel able to do) for a minute. Please ignore this step if you do not feel it is safe for you to do so.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Check that your test is addressed for you before starting. This is especially important if other members of your household are also having the test done.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Lay your kit out on a low table and get familiar with the components. Your hand has to be below your heart, at all times, to maintain the blood flow. Using a low table also makes it easier to angle the blood into the tube. If it's like this [DEMONSTRATE] your blood won't flow as easily.  </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Don't forget to stay standing for the whole process! If you live with someone, ask for their help while you collect your sample. If you feel faint at any point, sit down. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">It's important to note that your kit might not look exactly like this. Always check the paper instructions in your kit.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Grab a clean tissue. Then fill a large jug or bowl, or even your sink, with warm water. The water should be the temperature of bath water. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Twist the cap off the tube and stand the tube upright using the slot in the plastic case (found at the top corner).</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Prepare the plaster so that it's ready to pop on your finger.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Start by putting your whole non-dominant hand into the warm water — you want your whole hand to be submerged, not just your fingertips. Soak your whole hand for at least two minutes so that it gets nice and warm. Some people might like to start with a shower and then warm their hand – but it depends on how much time you have. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Once your hand is nice and warm, take it out of the water and dry it with a clean tissue or clean towel.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Part 2: Collect your sample</h3>

                <p class="govuk-body">Start by cleaning your finger with the alcohol wipe. We recommend using your ring finger as your blood flow tends to be best in this finger. But some people prefer to use their little finger. Try whichever you're comfortable with or whichever has worked for you before.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Now get a lancet.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you have a lancet that looks like this: Remove the protective tip at the bottom of the lancet: twist the tip (one full turn) and then pull it all the way out. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you have a lancet that looks like this: Twist off the lancet top.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Place your hand face up on a hard surface (like a table top) so the lancet can work properly. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Also, if you're nervous of needles, you won't see any needle before or after using the lancet. But if you don't like using the lancet, you can always get a friend or family member to do it for you.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Press the lancet down on the outer centre of your fingertip — this part is less sensitive and it's easier to direct your blood.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you have a lancet that looks like this: Press down firmly on the purple button until you hear a click. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you have a lancet that looks like this:  Press the lancet firmly down on your finger until you hear a click. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">You can only use each lancet once.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Firmly wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean tissue.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Massage your hand from the top to just before the piercing in a downward motion. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Don't squeeze too hard or get too close to the piercing or you might damage the sample. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Wait 3-4 seconds between each massage so there's enough blood to massage out. Tap the drops of blood against the top of the tube to help guide it in. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If your blood flow starts to slow down at all, you can wipe the tip of your finger with a tissue. This can help your blood to start flowing again. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">But if it's taking more than two minutes to fill a tube, it’s better to start from the beginning.  Re-warm your hand and do some more light exercise. Then prick the corner of a new finger with a new lancet. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you have a tube that looks like this: A) You should fill the tube to the 600 line. If you only fill to the 400 line, that's OK.  </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">When you have got enough blood, immediately place the cap onto the tube. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Push the cap on firmly. If you have a tube that looks like this  make sure you push until it clicks. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Slowly and gently turn the tube upside down at least 10 times — make sure not to shake it.  Do not worry if the blood solidifies when it’s mixed. This is supposed to happen.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">When the bleeding has stopped, clean your finger with the moist wipe and apply the plaster.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Make sure you clean up any blood spills immediately and disinfect the surrounding area.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Part 3: Label and post</h3>

                <p class="govuk-body">OK, last bit! </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Peel your tube label from the returns form and wrap it around the tube. Make sure the printed code is visible.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Fill in the date and time on your return form. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Put the tube in the protective plastic case and put both used and unused lancets into the plastic envelope. Put the tube plastic casing, plastic envelope, and completed return form into the prepaid mailer.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Post your sample in a priority postbox. They are labelled with the NHS logo. <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you">You can find your nearest priority postbox using the Royal Mail website.</a> These are collected from most frequently. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you're not able to safely get to a priority postbox, use your local postbox.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Do not go to a post office to post your sample.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Dispose safely of all equipment.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">When your sample is received by the lab, you will get a notification. When your results are ready, you'll receive another notification.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">That's it! Thank you for following along. </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you weren't able to collect enough blood, contact NHS using the details below. </p>

        </details>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Avoid common mistakes</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">Before you start your test, watch the video and always read the instructions to make sure you:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>follow the tips to get blood flowing before you start - it makes it easier</li>
            <li>collect the right amount of blood</li>

            <li>follow the instructions to return your sample correctly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">If you cannot get enough blood</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can prick a different finger to try and get the right amount of blood needed for the test. You must follow the instructions and only use lancets from your kit.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You must not complete the test if you have run out of lancets. Instead, follow the instructions to dispose of your test safely. You can register again to get a new test.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">You will not be sent a result if your sample does not contain enough blood.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Safe lancet disposal</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Lancets (the device you use to prick your finger) can cause injury and carry blood-borne viruses.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Return all used and unused lancets with your blood sample.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Do not put lancets in your recycling or household waste.</p>
