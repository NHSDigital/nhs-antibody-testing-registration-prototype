    <p class="govuk-body-l">You can now sign up for a fingerprick blood test (antibody test) if you're a teacher or teaching support staff.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-l">It does not matter if you've had coronavirus before or not.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About the test</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The coronavirus (COVID-19) antibody test is a fingerprick blood test that you do at home (it is sent to you in the post).</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The home test kit comes with everything you need and simple step-by-step instructions. There's a video to help you.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You take the test and return your sample in the post. You'll get your results a few days later.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why take the test</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The test checks for coronavirus antibodies. If you have them, it's likely you've had the virus before.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Your details will help the NHS and research scientists. They need to learn more about who has already had the virus and how it is spreading.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This is not an immunity test. It cannot tell you when you had the virus or how effective (if at all) any antibodies are. COVID-19 is a new virus and doctors do not yet know if it is possible for you to catch it again or spread it.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Learn more about what antibody testing will tell you</a></p>

    <!--      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Find out more about who counts a teaching or teaching support staff.</a></p>-->

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to sign up</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll need a mobile phone that can receive text messages.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll be asked some questions to check you're eligible and to get some basic information about you. It takes 5 to 10 minutes to sign up.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Then, you'll need to wait to receive a text. The text will invite you to order a home test kit when one becomes available.</p>
