              You can use this service to check if you’re eligible to get an antibody test kit.<br><br>
              Once you have confirmed your eligibility and entered your personal details, you’ll get an email or text message inviting you to order a test kit. This can take up to 3 weeks.<br><br>
              The test kit is posted to you. It comes with everything you need. You take the test and post your sample back. Then you’ll get your results.<br><br>
              It should take 5 to 10 minutes to check if you’re eligible and enter your personal details.
