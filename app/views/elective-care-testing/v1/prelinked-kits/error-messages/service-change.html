        <p>If you are a patient who is preparing for a surgery or procedure, you no longer need to register your test kit after receiving it. You do not need to do anything else until you get a text with further instructions on booking your courier.</p>

        <p>If you are looking to register a home test kit and you are not a patient who is preparing for a surgery or procedure, you should click the below button to register your kit the correct way.</p>
