      <p class="govuk-body">
        Dear {{ data['first-name'] or 'John' }} {{ data['last-name'] or 'Smith' }}<br><br>
        Thank you for ordering a pack of 7 rapid lateral flow home test kits.<br><br>
        Your test pack should have arrived. If not, use the tracking email sent to you by Royal Mail, or call the contact centre (details below).
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">1) Testing when you do not have symptoms</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        About 1 in 3 people with coronavirus do not have symptoms but can still infect others.<br><br>
        Getting tested regularly is the only way to know if you have the virus. If people test positive and self-isolate, it helps stop the virus spreading.<br><br>
        Take the test twice a week (3 or 4 days apart) and get more tests as and when you need (see below).
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">2) Help taking the test</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Remember: 
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-top-5">
        <li>always read the instructions before you start</li>
        <li>watch the short video: how to take a rapid test</li>
        <li>get the instructions in other languages and formats (easy read or large print)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">3) Always report every result - whatever it is</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Report every result (positive, negative or void) to the NHS on the day you take the test (and no later than 24 hours). Try to do it as soon as you get the result. 
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Save time: report online and use your NHS login (you can set one up the first time you report).
      </p>
      <span class="govuk-body">
          Go to GOV.UK: <a href="../../../share-result-lateral-flow/v13/" class="govuk-link">www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result</a>
      </span>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">4) If you test negative, positive or get coronavirus symptoms</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you test negative, keep following coronavirus advice including regular handwashing, social distancing and wearing a face covering.<br><br>
        If you test positive or get coronavirus symptoms, make sure you self-isolate immediately and get a PCR test (a different coronavirus test) to confirm the result.
