      <p class="govuk-body">
        Dear {{ data['first-name'] or 'John' }} {{ data['last-name'] or 'Smith' }}<br><br>
        Thank you for taking part in regular twice weekly testing.<br><br>
        Your test pack should have arrived. If not, use the tracking email sent to you by Royal Mail, or call the contact centre (details below).
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">1). Why regular testing if you do not have symptoms is important</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Around 1 in 3 people with coronavirus do not have any symptoms. This means they could be spreading coronavirus without knowing it.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Testing twice a week (3 or 4 days apart) and reporting every result to the NHS on time will: 
      </p>      
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-top-5">
        <li>stop the spread of the virus</li>
        <li>reduce transmission/infection rates</li>
        <li>help protect the NHS and save lives</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">2). Your household (or bubble) should test twice a week</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        It's best if your household (or bubble) all test twice a week 3 or 4 days apart. Try to do this all on the same day, and around the same time.<br><br>
        Avoid an invalid (void) result:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-top-5">
        <li>always read the instructions before you start</li>
        <li>watch the video on how to take a rapid test</li>
        <li>get the instructions in other languages and formats (easy read / large print)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">Go to GOV.UK: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-self-test-help" class="govuk-link">www.gov.uk/rapid-lateral-flow tests</a></p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">3). Report every result</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Report every result (whatever it is) to the NHS on the day you take the test (and no later than 24 hours later)<br><br>
        To save time, report online and use your NHS Login (you can set one up the first time you report).
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">4). Order more tests</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your test pack contains 7 tests.<br><br>
        You can quickly and easily get more. Do this before you take your last test.<br><br>
        There are 2 ways:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-top-5">
        <li>collect from a test site - get it the same day</li>
        <li>order online - get it within 2 days</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">Go to GOV.UK: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-self-test-help" class="govuk-link">www.gov.uk/rapid-lateral-flow tests</a></p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-7">5). Stop twice weekly testing if...</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If anyone in the household (or bubble) tests positive or gets coronavirus symptoms, tell the school and:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-top-5">
        <li>stop using the tests</li>
        <li>you must all stay at home</li>
        <li>those with symptoms must self-isolate immediately</li>
        <li>those with symptoms must get a different test to check if they have the virus</li>
        <li>follow the advice given to you when they get their results</li>
